        <h2>Chapter 1 - The meteorite crash</h2>

        <p>“It was a sunny day in our village, a nice village. Everything was fine. No one had any problems. Nobody needed to travel out of it. Everything was available. That day, I was wandering about and I met Mr. Jangers. He was in his especially happy mood today. He was a person who wouldn’t end an argument without a fight in his bad moods and greet everyone for a ‘great’ morning in his good moods. He wished me ‘an extremely great morning’ and I couldn’t resist saying the same thing to him too. After all, his smile made everyone smile. I had breakfast which consisted of cornflakes. I was a fan of cornflakes. Perhaps, everyone in the entire world knew how much I loved cornflakes! Whenever I was meeting someone, I had a bowl of cornflakes in my hand as soon as I entered. Just then, WHISH. And a spoonful of cornflakes flew from my spoon. I got up to shut the window. It was probably a windy day. I closed the window and SMASH…CRUNCH. The window broke. Something else to work on in summer. I looked at the sky. Nothing was wrong. I was wrong. The entire sky turned to a bright yellow. And I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Even you would not believe it if a gigantic meteorite came crashing down at you.</p>
        <br>

        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>It fell into a forest and the entire forest was flaming. An aftershock, I think, came and everyone’s houses were probably huts, including mine. The chimney was split in two. The roof had thousands of holes in it. Half of the bricks had fallen down. It was a miracle that the house was standing. Then POOF. A cloud of ash covered the sky. Everything was black. It seemed as if everything was invisible. Everyone escaped just in time because sparks of fire had started raining on the village. We all now know that there was more to that impact than we thought,” said George Bran. John Tine, Steve Tine and Jim Steel were sitting with him in Hendor’s bungalow.</p>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“So we have to talk to those aliens that Mr. Jangers was reporting,” said John, ending the long silence. “Yes, but how?” asked Steve. “They have advanced technologies. They cannot have survived in meteorites entering the atmosphere,” informed Hendor, suddenly coming in the room. “Then we must see them tomorrow,” said Jim.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2 - Njhcfagnfs</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>The next day, John, Jim, Steve and Hendor set out to the village. “George says that the village is quite near the river Georgington,” told Jim. Georgington was far away and it took a day to reach a village since it was over the plains of Georgville. There were no roads built over it. When they reached it, the village was neat clean and green, unlike George’s description! First, they knocked on the door of the first house in the row. A human with long, pointy elf-like ears opened the door.</p>
        <br>
        <img width="250" src="man.png">
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>He said something in a language no one could understand. “What?” asked John, a little confused. “Sorry, I didn’t know you speak English. I have to think that to the translator. Let me introduce myself. I am Njhcfagnfs. It is pronounced Nuh-jhuk-fagan-fus.” “Hi. I am Hendor Drim. We need to talk to your mayor once,” said Hendor. “I am the mayor,” he replied. “Oh! We did not know! We wanted to talk about the meteorite crash and why you are here,” said Steve. “We came through the meteorite. We don’t have any problem in cooling the inner part. We wanted the Thwaiy metal in the soil for protection against the rare Molar Flare. We can’t do that because your soil is Enamel to our diggers. We were just thinking about what to do. We found the traces of Thwaiy over here only,” he replied.</p>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“Even we didn’t know about Thwaiy. Thank you for the information. We can use our post hole diggers for that,” said Steve. “Thank you for your offer. We should start digging soon,” informed Njhcfagnfs.</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>The four of them were soon ready for the job. “Start your post hole diggers!” shouted John in excitement. Everyone did exactly as told and started digging. DDDDDRRRRR was the noise that echoed everywhere. Sand, concrete and gravel was flying here and there. In no time, the hole was extremely deep. They had made a plan to escape through the bent and empty well near the spot they had started digging. “We need to go deeper,” shouted Hendor. Once more, the noise of the diggers filled the pit. DDDDDRRRRR! Suddenly, CRACK! Jim had made a tiny hole that looked different. CLICK… CLICK… CLICK… CLICK… CLICK. CLACK! Steve peeped through the hole. There was a huge tunnel. Suddenly, two pincers came out of the hole and went under it. The ground was shaking. GRRRRRR! Something rumbled. Steve spotted what looked like an enormous termite!</p>
        <br>
        <img width="250" src="termite.png">
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“What is this!” he shouted up the hole. “Is there something down there?” asked Njhcfagnfs. “Yes! There are enormous termites,” exclaimed Steve. “They must have come with us in the meteorite. They had destroyed half of our planet. They are extremely dangerous! Keep away from them,” shouted Njhcfagnfs down the hole. “They have blocked our way down. We can’t fulfil your wish. We will meet you at the extraction point,” said Jim.</p>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>So, they started making a tunnel to the well. As they were doing this, thousands of termites were going under the ground they were standing on. The DDDDDRRRRR of the post hole diggers was screaming and there was a continuous CLICK and an occasional
            CLACK under them. They were getting closer and closer to the well. Their hopes of getting away from the termites were rising. Then, CLACK. This had not come from under them. This was nearer. Yet, they kept on digging just to find that their path was blocked.</p>

        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>CRUMBLE! Some rocks fell into a pit in front of everyone. They looked up and an enormous termite mound was standing in front of them! Hendor ran towards the starting point and shouted, “Give a rope! The way to the well is blocked by a termite mound.” A group of aliens threw a rope towards the hole. The rest of the four ran and with the help of the aliens, all of them were safely at the top the hole. Just then, SNIP SNIP SNIP SNIP. A termite climbed the wall and came to the top of the hole. The group ran to the well for safety. Once more, their plans failed as another termite came up the well. They escaped to the safety of Hendor’s bungalow through a specialized car by the aliens.</p>

        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“I am sorry that I didn’t tell you this. The termites are a creation by us. In an experiment at the Celestial Lab of Experiment or the CLOE, we were studying about making objects larger but during the ultimate test of testing it on living organisms, everything went wrong. We gave the termites the Hollow Pellets (HP) and used the Large-Maker Guns (LMG) on them. They became larger but destroyed everything!” told Njhcfagnfs.</p>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“We have to think of a way of taking them away from Earth and your planet. We can use something and think of something for that. Then, we shall give you the Thwaiy,” said Jim, firmly. “We can use rockets to send them away,” suggested John. “How?” asked Njhcfagnfs. “If we can use the instruments you mentioned, we can make the rocket larger. Do you have something that makes objects longer?” asked John. “Yes, we have the Long-Maker Guns (LG),” replied Njhcfagnfs. “Then my plan will work,” said John.</p>

        <p>John came from the drawing room and placed a hand-drawn map on the table. It had a circle with ‘Well’ written on it on the left and a black circle with ‘Hole’ written above it, towards the right of the map. Village was written above both of them. A blue coloured strip was above that and Georgington was written on it. Beside that, Georgville was written. On the opposite side, launch pad was written inside a rectangle. “This is the map of where we have been and where we will go,” said John.</p>
        <br>
        <img width="250" id="map" src="map.png">
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“My plan is to make the rocket and the station bigger with the instruments. The next part in the plan is to ward the termites towards it by placing dead plants and trees inside the rocket at the very top. All of the termites will go there and we will launch them,” continued John.</p>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“Pass me the HPs!” shouted Hendor. Njhcfagnfs gave them to Hendor. The plan had started to work. Hendor and Jim placed a pellet in each chamber. The HPs and LMGs worked synonymously. One would work only if the other was working. Now was Steve’s job. He took the LGs and sprayed the liquid in them on every wire and pipe. Soon, there was a mess of wires and pipes everywhere. Now, all the mess would be cleared as John would spray the liquid in the LMGs on everything. “I am ready John,” said Steve to John. “Everybody! Please stay away from here. I am going to spray this,” yelled John. PHISSSSS… PHISSSSS… PHIS… PHISSSSSSSSSS!</p>

        <p>Once again… PHISSSSS… PHISSSSS… PHIS… PHISSSSSSSSSS! It was happening! The rocket was becoming larger and larger and larger and larger! Now it could fit all of them inside it! “It worked! Let’s fill the top with all kinds of dead plants and trees!” exclaimed John. “I’m here,” said Njhcfagnfs, brilliantly driving a huge truck with an entire truckload of exactly what they wanted. They filled the top of the rocket with it and now they had to wait… Then the ground started shaking. THUD! THUD! THUD! The volume was increasing and increasing until it was a deafening noise. THUD! THUD! CRASH! THUD! CLICK! CLICK! THUD! CLICK! CLACK! CRASH! CRUNCH! THUD! THUD! THUD!</p>
        <br>

        <p>The termites had come. They were marching towards the rocker. They had to enter the command capsule. They must enter the command capsule. And they did! Climbing up and down was no problem for them. They clung to the walls of the command capsule. Obviously, everyone down on the ground didn’t know that. All they could do was hope that they were at the right place. The termites, on the other hand, didn’t have any controls inside the command capsule. They were already disconnected.</p>
        <pre>|</pre>
        <p>“10, 9, 8, 7, 6,” yelled John. Everyone joined in. “5, 4, 3, 2, 1…” POOF! This deafening noise was even more deafening than the noise made by the termites. The rocket left and everyone ran away. They didn’t want anything crushing them. Nobody noticed that all this while Njhcfagnfs, Steve and Jim were not there. “Where are the rest of us? I mean that Njhcfagnfs, Jim and Steve are missing,” asked Hendor. “There they are!” exclaimed John pointing towards the three of them. “We have just been collecting Thwaiy. Farewell everyone. We have to leave. The Molar Flare is due anytime,” said Njhcfagnfs. The next day, the aliens left Earth through a space shuttle (not a meteorite). The termites were safely on a planet where it was like Earth but there was nothing except plants there. The humans too were happy with the incident since they got a new element on the periodic table called Thwaiy.</p>
